- docstrings
  - they don't have to duplicate info in man 2, but should at least make the
    C/python mapping clear
- namedtuple types for the tuples these functions return
  - timer with (timeout, interval)
  - siginfo, so far with (signum, code)
- pull more siginfo fields out in read_signalfd (really in unwrap_siginfo)
- int constants for the possible values of signalfd_siginfo.ssi_code
- return a set of signums from sigprocmask() instead of a list
  - get python version issues straight back to 2.5
- python 3 compatibility
